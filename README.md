# Welcome to my Redesign of CactusModelingInc.'s Site

## Description
- Beginning as a project where I was hoping to share the design w/ the company, to a plot twist of lies, scams, and the works, my current CactusModelingInc redesign is now just a static project that I continue to host because I personally enjoyed playing w/ such minimalistic styling! It is my pleasure to share this site with others, and I really hope you enjoy the experience!
	- Overall, this project is anecdotally comical to me, but the work I put in and the effect that came out of my redesign made the disappointment worth it

## Known Issues
- Images were directly sourced from the original site, and one of those images no longer displays. Upon going to re-retrieve the image, I quickly unraveled that the company site was a scam, and perhaps the company itself...allegedly. While I cannot legally say with certainty, I will say it is awfully strange for a modeling agency's site to make use of stock photos over their own. To maintain that transparency, I am choosing to leave the image blank w/ alt-text displayed instead in hopes that this little story will be mentioned, and others will learn about the possible scam this local 'agency' is running.

## Stack
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JS in ES6

## Other Information
- While the images of the models are directly sourced from the site (exc. 1), all of the SVG's present are my own making and design
- The entire site was wireframed prior to development in Figma (I can't bare w/ the Adobe news- heartbreaking)
- Animations are all solely CSS keyframe-based or transitions w/ exception of the parallax fade-in, done using a js library
